# Animal recognition for self-driving cars

VisionTech Solutions wants to develop an automatic image recognition system to distinguish between vehicles and animals, with the aim of optimizing wildlife monitoring operations in urban areas, avoiding road accidents and protecting both animals and vehicles.

VisionTech Solutions works with city governments to implement a real-time monitoring system in cities, using cameras installed along roads to identify and classify vehicles and animals. This system will help prevent road accidents caused by sudden crossing of animals by alerting drivers via electronic road signs.

Benefits:

1. **Process Automation:**
    - Reduced time and resources to manually monitor urban areas.
    - Automatic and real-time detection of animals and vehicles.
2. **Increased Accuracy:**
    - Use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to ensure high precision in image classification.
    - Minimization of human errors.
3. **Operational Efficiency:**
    - Fast and accurate processing of large volumes of data, improving event response.
    - Greater safety for citizens and reduction of damage to vehicles.
4. **Multiple Applications:**
    - Traffic surveillance and monitoring.
    - Analysis of animal behavior in urban areas.
    - Use of data to improve road safety policies.

**Project Details:**

1. **Dataset:**
    - Use of the CIFAR dataset, containing thousands of images labeled in various categories, including vehicles and animals.
2. **Algorithm:**
    - Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis and classification.
3. **Output:**
    - The system will correctly classify each image as a vehicle or animal.

**Model Evaluation:**
    
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of images classified correctly compared to the total.
- **Precision:** Quality of positive predictions, indicating the proportion of correctly identified images.

**Results Analysis:**

- Identification of any error patterns.
- Evaluation of systematically confused image categories.
- Examination of incorrect images and reflection on possible improvements to the model.

**Final Result:**

- Comprehensive presentation of the convolutional neural network and its vehicle-animal discrimination capabilities.
- Detailed discussion of the metrics used and a critical analysis of the model's performance and limitations.

This project will provide VisionTech Solutions with an effective system to improve road safety and wildlife management in urban areas, demonstrating practical skills in applying machine learning to image recognition.
